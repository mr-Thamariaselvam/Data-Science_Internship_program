## ðŸ“Š Student Performance Data Analysis

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

### ðŸ§  Project Overview

The **Student Performance Data Analysis** project explores the *student-mat.csv* dataset to understand how factors like study time, gender, and habits influence studentsâ€™ final grades.

### ðŸ›  Responsibilities

1. **Load Dataset** using Pandas and inspect the data structure.
2. **Explore & Clean Data** â€” checked for missing values, removed duplicates, and validated data types.
3. **Perform Analysis** to find:

   * Average final grade (G3)
   * Number of students scoring above 15
   * Correlation between study time and performance
   * Which gender performs better on average
4. **Visualizations**

   * Histogram of student grades
   * Scatterplot: Study Time vs Final Grade
   * Bar Chart: Male vs Female Average Score
5. **Documentation** using Markdown to clearly explain each step inside Jupyter Notebook.

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

* Average final grade and performance trends were identified.
* Study time shows a positive correlation with final grades.
* Visual comparisons reveal gender-based performance differences.

### ðŸ’¡ Outcome

This analysis helped uncover meaningful patterns in student behavior and performance using real data. It demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization** using Python.
